First I imported the os and the csv file
Then I added a keep going variable which causes the program to run again if the user enters y
Then i added the main function 
Then I added a fuction to read the data from the csv file
Then I added a function for serial searching which prints out the date and the amount of money gained/loss
Then I called the main function in a while loop to ask the user if they want to run the program again and to enter y if they do
